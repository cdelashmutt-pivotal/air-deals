An example of orchestrated services using SI to handle airline check in with boarding pass printing and included coupon selected based on a logistic regression model.

The story is that a company that writes software for airlines has a set of services that they have provided in the past for handling check-ins, and printing boarding passes.  This company is looking to add revenue streams by including targeted ads on boarding passes that match user preferences.  Coupon redemption is used to refine recommendation models to provide targeted advertising that better matches with what the passenger is more likely to actually purchase.
